		 <span class="card-title red-text"><h5>Gunther</h5></span>
		 <p>Gunther (James Michael Tyler): The manager of the Central Perk coffee house, who first appears as a background character in "The One with the Sonogram at the End". He is a former actor who once played Bryce on All My Children before that character was "killed in an avalanche."[e 12] Gunther develops an unrequited crush on Rachel in the third season, which he keeps to himself until "The Last One".[e 2] Apart from Ross, whom he dislikes, he is on reasonably good terms with the rest of the gang despite occasionally being annoyed by wacky antics or comments from them. His motivation for disliking Ross is jealousy (as he is aware of Ross' relationship with Rachel), which is made clear numerous times, most notably in "The One the Morning After" when he reveals to Rachel that Ross (who mistakenly thought at the time that his relationship with her was over—"We were on a break") got drunk and cheated on her.[e 13] Gunther appears in nearly every episode, but only occasionally calls attention to himself and almost never has a large role in the plot of an episode.

		 <span class="card-title red-text"><h5>Jack and Judy Geller</h5></span>
		 <p>Jack (Elliott Gould) and Judy Geller (Christina Pickles): Ross and Monica's parents. In early appearances, Jack frequently makes inappropriate comments, which he punctuates by exclaiming "I'm just saying...!" Judy often makes condescending remarks about Monica's lack of a love life and sometimes forgets her daughter even exists, while simultaneously favoring Ross. Jack is more balanced in his attention and care towards both Ross and Monica. Despite each of them having their own quirks, however, they are both occasionally dumbfounded by the crazy antics of their son and daughter, such as Ross' disastrous wedding to Emily and Monica's ridiculous speech at their 35th anniversary party.

		 <span class="card-title red-text"><h5>Janice Goralnik</h5></span>
		 <p>Janice Litman Goralnik (née Hosenstein) (Maggie Wheeler): Chandler's on-again, off-again girlfriend for the first four seasons. Janice is one of the few characters besides the six main friends who appears in all of the Friends seasons. She has a nasal voice and a thick New York accent that sounds so irritating that it makes Chandler want to break up with her, but at the same time he does not want to hurt the nonetheless good-natured Janice's feelings, and while making a hand gesture in the midst of an attempt to break up with her without upsetting her, he accidentally pokes her in the eye in "The One with the East German Laundry Detergent"[e 19] and although Phoebe is eventually able to explain to Janice on his behalf that he wants to end their relationship and get her to agree to break up with him without upsetting her in the process, he gets back together with her for New Year's[e 15] and for Valentine's.

		 <span class="card-title red-text"><h5>Richard Burke</h5></span>
		 <p>Dr. Richard Burke (Tom Selleck): an ophthalmologist and best friend of Jack Geller. He begins to date her despite being 21 years older, infuriating Monica's parents when they find out.[e 65] He and Monica break up in "The One with Barry and Mindy's Wedding"[e 5] when he tells her he does not want more children, his own having already reached adulthood. Despite the two still being in love, they cannot reconcile this difference, and are both devastated for months. He makes a brief voice cameo in "The One Where No One's Ready",[e 66] and later they briefly attempt to rekindle their romance as "friends" before accepting that the reasons they broke up remain valid.

		 <span class="card-title red-text"><h5>Tag Jones</h5></span>
		 <p>Thomas "Tag" Jones (Eddie Cahill): Rachel's inexperienced but attractive new assistant at Polo Ralph Lauren. She hires him after being promoted, not because he is the best choice for the job but because she is smitten with him, bemusing him with her daft behavior around him.[e 93] After he eventually becomes interested in her also, they try to keep their relationship a secret from her boss Zelner; otherwise, Tag's employment would be a conflict of interest.[e 94] In "The One Where They All Turn Thirty", Rachel breaks up with Tag when she realizes that their six-year age difference makes him too young and immature for her to be dating if she intends to follow her marriage schedule.
